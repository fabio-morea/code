# introduction

## Networks and communities

Network analysis is a powerful tool for understanding complex systems in
both the hard and social sciences. By representing data as a network, it
is possible to identify communities of similar members, or nodes, that
are connected to each other by various relationships.

This allows to gain insights into the structure of the system, as well
as the behavior of the nodes within it.

*For example, in social networks, nodes can represent people, and the
relationships between them can represent various types of interactions,
such as friendships or collaborations. By analyzing the network,
researchers can identify clusters of people who are more likely to
interact with each other, or who share similar characteristics.*

## Networks and communities: a toy example

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
g <- make_graph("Zachary") # "karate" 
comms <- cluster_louvain(g) 
plot(comms, g, layout = layout_with_graphopt)
```

## Communities in large networks

As the size of a network increases, the complexity of the network also
increases, making it difficult to represent the network in a simple
visual format. As a result, a simple visualization may not provide much
clarity in understanding the structure of the network. To gain a better
understanding of a large network, more sophisticated visualizations and
analysis techniques are needed.

## About LFR benchmark networks

LFR (Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi) benchmark graphs are synthetic
networks used to evaluate the performance of network analysis
algorithms. They are generated using a stochastic block model and are
designed to have realistic community structure, degree distributions,
and other properties of real-world networks.

They are used to test the accuracy of algorithms for network analysis
tasks such as community detection, link prediction, and node
classification.

## coreness and strength

K-coreness is a measure of the centrality of a node within a network. It
is defined as the largest value of k such that the node belongs to a
subgraph of the network that is composed of nodes with at least degree
k. A node with a high k-coreness is considered to be more central and
influential within the network.

Strength is a measure of the total weight of the connections a node has
to other nodes in the network.

df0 <- data.frame(s = strength(g), c = coreness(g))

# 3 - unsupervised community detection

## What is a community

the definition of 'community' in network analysis depends on the context
and the researcher's goals. for example:

1.  a community is a group of nodes that are more densely connected to
    each other than to the rest of the network.

2.  a community is group of nodes that share certain characteristics,
    such as having similar properties

3.  a community is a group of nodes that are more likely to interact
    with each other than with other nodes in the network.

4.  ...

## Modularity based community detection (1)

-   **Assumptions**:

    -   community is subset of nodes that are more densely connected to
        each other than to the rest of the network

    -   partition

    -   unsupervised ("true labels" are not available - or not used for
        community detection)

## Modularity based community detection (2)

-   **Definition of Modularity**: Given a network G partitioned into a
    number of communities Gi, modularity Q(G,Gi) is a function measuring
    the extent to which edge density is higher within than between
    communities. i.e. a partition of G that maximises Q results in
    communities that have strong internal connections and weak
    connections with other communities

*A partition with a higher modularity score indicates that the edges
within the partition are denser than the edges between partitions,
suggesting strong internal connections and weak connections with other
communities. **The optimal partition maximizes modularity***

## Louvain community detection algorithm

Modularity optimization, by means of a hierarchical approach.

1.  Initiates by partitioning the network so that each vertex is
    assigned to a single community.

2.  Starting with a random vertex Vi, it computes the potential
    variation in modularity Î”Qi j that would occur by aggregating Vi to
    each of its neighbours Vj.

3.  If max(Î”Qik) \> 0 then, Vi is removed from its original community
    and aggregated to the neighbour Vk that maximises the gain.

4.  The number of communities is thus reduced, and process is repeated
    sequentially for all other vertices until max(Î”Qik)â‰¤0 .

As all methods based on modularity optimization it is biased by some
intrinsic limits

-   greedy (find local optima)

-   Results depend on user-defined parameters

-   results depend on random initialisation and sequence of vrtices

# 5. consensus and "robustness of membership"

## inspired by 'random forrest" algorithm

Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines
the results produced by multiple independent instances of 'regression
tree' (or 'decision tree') to obtain predictive performance than could
be obtained from any of the 'trees' alone.

The algorithm builds N = 500 trees, each based on a randomly selected
subset of features from the training dataset. The final prediction is
made by averaging the predictions (or selecting the mode) of all the N
trees.

**note**: Random Forest is a *supervised* algorithm (community detection
is *unsupervised*)

## Consensus community detection (CCD)

CCD can be used to enhance both the stability and the accuracy of the
resulting partitions, reducing dependence on user-defined parameters and
random initialization

Principles:

    -   **Independent trials**

    -   **Consensus**

    -   **Pruning**

## Consensus community detection (CCD)

**Independent trials:** The Louvain community detection algorithm is
repeated Ni times, and at each iteration only a part of the information
in the network is used i.e. a randomly chosen fraction Î± of edges is
assigned a weight W0 (small, but non-zero). The resulting network is not
losing connectivity, but edges associated with W0 are more likely to be
assigned to different community at each iteration

## Consensus community detection (CCD)

**Consensus**: the consensus algorithm counts how many times a pair of
vertices Vi and Vj are assigned to the same community and assigns a
***proportion of membership*** PVij âˆˆ [0,1].

Vertices that are strongly connected to one another are always assigned
to the same community and have PVij = 1; lower values of Pvij indicate
that the vertex is not strongly connected to its neighbors, and it may
be assigned to two or more communities with some degree of confidence.

## Consensus community detection (CCD)

**Pruning**: The algorithm creates a meta-community labelled as
"community 0" defined by regular equivalence (i.e. vertices covering the
same "marginal" role in the network):

-   Vertices with max(Pvij) \< 0.5
-   Trivially small communities of size Scommunity \< Scmin ,
-   Trivially small communities of weight Wcommunity \< Wcmin

## CCD parameters

Independent trials

-   \- N repetitions: independent repetitions of the whole procedure

-   \- N trials: independent trials of modularity based community
    detection

Consensus

-   Alpha: fraction of edges that is assigned a weight W0. *default
    0.05*

-   Epsilon: to set the appropriate value of W0 = min(Wi \* Epsilon)
    *default 0.01*

-   Resolution: parameter of Louvain Community Detection *default 1.0*

-   P_threshold: proportion of membership threshold *default 0.5*

## simulation plan (1)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
source('source_functions_cons_com_det.r')
```

## simulation plan (2)

We simulate several LFR networks setting different parameters hat
reproduce some of the key structural features of a network of interest
(labour market network of Friuli Venezia Giulia)

-   N=1000

-   Average degree = 10

-   Community size min = 20 max = 50 Tau1 = 2

-   Tau2 = 3

-   mu { 0.1, 0.2, .... 0.9 }

-   Mu is the crucial parameter for our test, as it governs the
    fuzziness of communities.
